        <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
        <!--Poet'sName-->
        <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
        <!--Poem-->
        <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/> 
        Who said — “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
        Stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand, <br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br/>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br/> 
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br/> 
        Which yet survive, stamped on these life less things, <br/>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br/>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br/>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings; <br/>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br/>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away. ” <br/>
    </p>
